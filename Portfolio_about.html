                                           Hey! I'm Ben, welcome to this little page I made. I was born to Israeli / Brazilian
                                        parents and we moved to NYC when I was 2. I spent most of my development years in NYC (except
                                        for half of my highschool years which were spent in Brazil). After high school I decided to be
                                        somehwat of a nomad, I spent a few years working odd jobs from making promotional videos for 
                                        small NGOs to working in small shops, with a good 
                                        habit of getting stuck in places for extended periods of time. In 2013 I moved to Melbourne to attend La 
                                        Trobe Univercity. After graduating with a BA in International Development as well as 
                                        doing a Permaculture Design Course (PDC), I went to and island off the southern coast 
                                        of Cambodia to work for an NGO there called

                                        and worked with a local community teaching english and sustainable designs. I've returned to Australia
                                        since then have been studying coding and programming.
