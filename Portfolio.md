## Brainstorming

When starting this portfolio I a had no idea what I wanted to do. How was I going to design it, what were my inspirations? After a while of trying to think about what to think about I started browsing my iTunes library to find some music to try to inspire my inspiration, and it hit me. Album covers are art. 

So I started taking inspiration from a few album covers as well as the music on the albums. I came up with a few different templates:

all these albums are sonically amazing. I eventually settled for one that wasn't even on my original list.
